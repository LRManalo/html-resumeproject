    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <h4>My name is Lorace Manalo and I am an engineer. Most of my career has been spent as a mechanical engineer 
        in the aerospace and defense industry focused on manufacturing and production. The latter half of my career 
        has been focused more on technical project management leading teams of engineers to meet key program design 
        milestones and production deliverables.</h4>

    <h4>Recently, I decided to upskill and add more tools to my toolbox by teaching myself how to code.  I'm only a few 
        weeks in, learning basic html hence this resume website. I'm looking forward to learning more on web development 
        and creating projects that people can find useful.</h4>
